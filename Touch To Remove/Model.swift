    let country:String!
    let slug:String!
    let nConf:String!
    //Create init function for one Country object. So when we create a country we can give it these string as well.
    init(country:String,slug:String,nConf:String) {
        self.country = country

//note: we can also use struct instead of class but you can't use subclass in struct.
